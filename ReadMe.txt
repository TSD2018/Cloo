Readme For CLoo

0.01 Dec 17, 2018 Kartik Venkataraman: First revision from the pre-prototype
    Included an object (singleton class) called CurrentLocation which stores
    the latlng once captured, and passes that on to all required classes.
    LocationAdaptor is modified to compute the distance (as the crow flies)
    between the toilet location and users current location.  Also the Rating
    is now shown as stars in the landing page instead of a number.
